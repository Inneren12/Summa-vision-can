## Étape C: Admin Panel (Flutter)

| PR | Title | Status | Dependencies |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| C-1 | Cube Search Screen | 🔄 | A-4, PR-20, PR-46 |
| C-2 | Data Preview | 🔄 | C-1, A-5 |
| C-3 | Chart Config + Generation Screen | 🔄 | C-2, B-4 |
| C-4 | Jobs Dashboard Screen | 🔄 | C-3, 0-2, 0-3 |
| C-5 | KPI Dashboard Screen | ✅ | C-3, 0-4 |

**Étape C status:** All PRs complete. ✅

**Étape C-4:** JobsDashboardScreen with filter bar (job type dropdown, status chips), summary stats bar (queued/running/success/failed/stale counts), scrollable job card list, job detail bottom sheet, retry button for retryable failed jobs, stale/zombie warning for jobs running >10 min, auto-refresh every 10s, MockInterceptor fixtures (8 sample jobs), freezed models, Riverpod providers, widget + model tests. Backend `POST /api/v1/admin/jobs/{job_id}/retry` endpoint with 404/409 handling.

**Étape C-1:** CubeSearchScreen with debounced search, CubeSearchTile, CubeDetailScreen stub, MockInterceptor fixtures, AppDrawer navigation, GoRouter routes, freezed models, Riverpod providers, widget + model tests.

**Étape C-3:** ChartConfigScreen with chart type / size preset / background category selectors, title field with validation, async generation flow (submit → poll → result), inline image preview with download button, MockInterceptor polling simulation, widget + model tests. Wires C-2 "Generate Chart" button to /graphics/config route.

**Étape C-5:** KPI Dashboard — backend `GET /api/v1/admin/kpi?days=30` aggregation endpoint (KPIService, KPIResponse schema). Flutter KPIScreen with period selector (7/30/90 days), summary cards (publications, leads, downloads, job success), download funnel visualization, lead breakdown by category, job failure chart, system health row, auto-refresh every 60s. MockInterceptor fixture, freezed model, Riverpod providers, widget + model tests.

## Étape B: Visual Engine

| PR | Title | Status | Dependencies |
|----|-------|--------|--------------|
| B-1 | SVG Generator → Real Data | 🔄 | A-5, A-6 |
| B-2 | Template Backgrounds | 🔄 | — |
| B-3 | End-to-End Pipeline | 🔄 | B-1, B-2 |
| B-4 | Admin Graphics API + Batch CLI | ⬜ | B-3 |
| B-5 | JSON/CSV Upload → Graphic Generation | ✅ | B-4 |

**B-5 status:** Admin can now feed arbitrary JSON/CSV into the same
graphic pipeline without going through a StatCan cube. Backend exposes
`POST /api/v1/admin/graphics/generate-from-data` which serializes rows
to a temporary Parquet under `temp/uploads/` and enqueues the existing
`graphics_generate` job — pipeline is *unchanged*. Flutter admin adds a
"StatCan Cube / Upload Data" toggle, a `DataUploadWidget` (JSON + CSV
parsing, dtype inference), and an editable `EditableDataTable` preview.
Temp Parquet cleanup tracked as DEBT-021.

**E-3-4 status (in flight):** Backend-only persistence PR. Adds a
nullable `Publication.review` Text column (Alembic migration
`f2a7d9c3b481`), a `ReviewPayload` schema, a workflow → status sync
rule in the PATCH router, five new `PUBLICATION_WORKFLOW_*` audit
event types, and augments `publish` / `unpublish` to mirror transitions
into `review.workflow`. Closes DEBT-024 (cosmetic rename
`validateDocumentShape` → `assertCanonicalDocumentV2Shape`) and removes
the demo workflow switcher from `infographic-editor-stage3b-v2.jsx`.
Stage 3 is functionally closed pending a consumer wire-up — no Next.js
admin route or Flutter integration is in scope; PR 4 establishes the
contract, a follow-up wires a consumer.

**E-3-1 status:** Data-layer only. `CanonicalDocument` now carries a `review`
section (workflow + workflow history + comments); root-level `workflow` is
moved under `review.workflow`; `schemaVersion` bumped 1 → 2 with a single
`v1 → v2` migration in `registry/guards.ts`. Renamed legacy `HistoryEntry`
(edit log) to `EditHistoryEntry` so the name is free for the new
`WorkflowHistoryEntry` type. Migration coverage lands in
`src/components/editor/__tests__/migrations.test.ts`. No reducer actions or UI
changed in this PR.

**E-3-2a status:** Workflow state machine landed in the reducer. Seven new
actions (`SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW`, `APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, `RETURN_TO_DRAFT`,
`MARK_EXPORTED`, `MARK_PUBLISHED`, `DUPLICATE_AS_DRAFT`) gated by
`canTransition` in `store/workflow.ts`. Permission gate is now two-axis:
existing `mode` axis (template|design) AND new `workflow` axis; both must
pass for any mutation to land. Copy-edit lockdown enforced in `in_review`.
Read-only transitions clear undo/redo. Deterministic timestamps via injected
`TimestampProvider`. Closes `DEBT-022` (validator unification) and the
`WorkflowHistoryEntry` half of `DEBT-023` (element shape validation). Adds
`DEBT-024` (cosmetic rename of `validateDocumentShape`). Comments subsystem
deferred to E-3-2b; UI to E-3-3.

**E-3-2b status:** Comments subsystem landed. Six new reducer actions
(`ADD_COMMENT`, `REPLY_TO_COMMENT`, `EDIT_COMMENT`, `RESOLVE_COMMENT`,
`REOPEN_COMMENT`, `DELETE_COMMENT`) implemented in `store/comments.ts` and
delegated from the reducer. Comment mutations live OUTSIDE the undo/redo
timeline — they do not call `push`, do not touch `undoStack`/`redoStack`,
and do not perturb `_lastAction`. Audit trail for ADD/REPLY/RESOLVE/REOPEN/
DELETE lands in `doc.review.history` (EDIT is intentionally unaudited).
New `canComment` dimension in `WORKFLOW_PERMISSIONS` keeps comments open
through `in_review` and freezes them in `approved|exported|published`.
Ownership check gates EDIT/DELETE on `comment.author === actor`; RESOLVE
and REOPEN are open to any commenter. `validateImportStrict` now
deep-validates every `Comment` element and enforces referential integrity
for `parentId`. Closes `DEBT-023`. UI surface (indicators, NoteModal,
Review panel) deferred to E-3-3.

**E-4-0 status (full close):** Wire-up landed on
`claude/wire-infographic-editor-9w3wr` (PR #101, merged) and the four
review blockers closed on follow-up branch
`claude/close-infographic-blockers-wkjVX`. New routes `/admin`
(publication list) and `/admin/editor/[id]` (editor page) under
`frontend-public/src/app/admin/`. Browser code talks to the backend
admin API via a same-origin Next.js proxy at
`src/app/api/admin/publications/[...path]/route.ts`; the proxy injects
`X-API-KEY` server-side from `ADMIN_API_KEY` (server-only env var,
never bundled to client). `InfographicEditor` gains `initialDoc?` and
`publicationId?` props; `initState` accepts an optional seed doc.
Ctrl+S PATCHes through `updateAdminPublication`; the legacy local-JSON
download on save is removed.

**E-4-2 status (full close):** Autosave landed on
`claude/stage4-task2-autosave`; review-fix close on
`claude/stage4-task2-fix-close-sxKZr`. Debounced 2000ms `useEffect` on
`state.doc` reference; navigational actions preserve identity so they
don't reset the timer. Reuses the Task 0 `SAVED_IF_MATCHES` /
`SAVE_FAILED` channel verbatim — no reducer changes. New local
`SaveStatus` enum (`idle | pending | saving | error`) drives a
four-state `SaveStatusIndicator` in TopBar (amber/red dot with CSS
keyframe pulse for `saving`). Exponential-backoff retry (2s/4s/8s/16s,
4 attempts) scheduled via an orthogonal effect watching
`state.saveError` + a `saveFailureGen` counter (required because
identical error strings would otherwise leave the dep array stable).
NotificationBanner save-error branch extended inline with live
countdown + "Retry now" button. `beforeunload` guard covers the 2s
window between an edit and the next scheduled save. Review-fix close
resolves three blockers: **B1** 404s no longer schedule auto-retries
(local `canAutoRetryRef` flag drives the retry-effect guard; zero
reducer changes); **B2** the debounce effect short-circuits while
`state.saveError` is set, so the retry effect is the sole save
orchestrator during error-state and edit-during-error produces a
single scheduled save at `delay[0]=2000ms` instead of two racing
timers; **B4** the debounce callback re-arms itself when `savingRef`
is held by an in-flight PATCH (previously a slow-network PATCH could
leave subsequent edits unsaved until a mutating action or Ctrl+S).
Test files: `autosave.test.tsx` (21 tests; +6 from close, +1 from B5),
`save-status-indicator.test.tsx` (6 tests), `_admin-api-mock.ts`
helper; extended `error-channels.test.tsx` with 5 retry-UX tests.
605 tests passing.

- B5 follow-up (dismiss bypass): debounce effect guard on
  `canAutoRetryRef.current`. Dismissing a 404 banner clears
  `state.saveError` but leaves `dirty = true`; before B5 the debounce
  effect re-ran on the `saveError → null` transition and scheduled a
  fresh 2s PATCH that immediately 404'd. The new guard (after the
  `state.saveError` check, before the `!dirty` check) short-circuits
  when the terminal flag is still set. Zero reducer / schema / API /
  banner changes. +1 test in the terminal-errors describe block.

Follow-up close resolves DEBT-026: opaque `document_state` column on
`Publication` (migration `a3e81c0f5d21`) carries the full
`CanonicalDocument` as JSON text; persistence seam
(`src/components/editor/utils/persistence.ts`) prefers it on hydrate
and falls back to the legacy field-level path for rows created before
the column existed. B2 stale-save fixed by snapshot-based
`SAVED_IF_MATCHES` — the reducer clears `dirty` only when
`state.doc === snapshotDoc`. B3 workflow demotion on legacy
PUBLISHED rows fixed by `deriveWorkflowFromStatus`. B4 separates
`saveError` from `importError` in reducer state; NotificationBanner
priority is `saveError > importError > _lastRejection > warnings`.
Entry point established for E-4-1 (click-to-select).

**E-3-3 status (in flight):** Stage 3 UI integration. Six new editor
components: `NoteModal` (the sole modal input surface; replaces any
prospective `window.prompt` for comment text and transition notes;
hand-rolled with focus trap + restore + Escape + Ctrl+Enter),
`StatusBadge` (compact in TopBar, regular in ReviewPanel header),
`RightRail` (tabbed parent for Inspector + Review), `ReviewPanel`
(workflow header with `availableTransitions`, threads with reply /
resolve / edit / delete affordances and tombstone rendering, history
list with reverse-chrono ordering and collapse-after-6), `ReadOnlyBanner`
(above-canvas notice when `isReadOnlyWorkflow(...)`, with one-click
"Return to draft" when allowed), and `NotificationBanner` (priority-
resolved in-app banner consuming `state._lastRejection` and the existing
import error/warning state). TopBar and LeftPanel pick up small
modifications: `<StatusBadge>` after the template chip; `unresolvedByBlock`
memo + count pill in block rows. `index.tsx` now computes
`effectivePerms` (mode × workflow overlay) so disabled buttons never
silently dispatch into a reducer rejection. Canvas stays clean — no
overlay layer (deferred). Editor test suite passes with ≥ 95% line
coverage on every new Stage 3 component (NoteModal, StatusBadge,
RightRail, ReviewPanel, ReadOnlyBanner, NotificationBanner) — see CI
for exact counts.
